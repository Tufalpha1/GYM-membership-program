# GYM-membership-program (Brooklyn 99 themed)
OOP final project.

This program first asks for your personal information. After filling personal info, it shows your encrypted info and asks whether you want to decrypt it or not.
Afterwards, it asks for the membership type: Monthly or yearly. Furthermore it asks you to choose one of the trainers (Amy, Jake, Terry). Then it asks for the training type. Chooosing a specific training type would display meal plan and training gear for that particular training type. Lastly it asks for payment via credit card.
